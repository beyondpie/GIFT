   Detailed information, such as protein names, pfam domains, pdb records and so
   on, for the proteins in gift from uniprot database.
   Note:
   - Several different labels might correspond to the same protein or genes.
   - We also have two proteins recorded as deleted.
   - MGR2_HUMAN, CDC2_HUMAN have two different protein records, which seem strange.
