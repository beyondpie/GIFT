GIFT
=========
An algorithm called GIFT is used to infer the chemogenmic information based on drug-protein interactions. Here chemogenomic information means the interactions between the chemical substructures and protein domains. An Expection-Maximum (EM) algorithm is derived.

## Need to Do
1. Update the original data (i.e., drug-protein interactions, protien-domain relationship.)
2. Try different kinds of drug chemical substructures.
3. Write the R package.
