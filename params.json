Here chemogenomic information means the interactions between the chemical substructures and protein domains. An Expection-Maximum (EM) algorithm is derived.  \r\nYou can also follow [the link] (http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/software/GIFT/)\r\n\r\n## Need to Do\r\n1. Update the original data (i.e., drug-protein interactions, protien-domain relationship.)\r\n2. Try different kinds of drug chemical substructures.\r\n3. Write the R package.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
