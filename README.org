* GIFT
An algorithm called [[http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/software/GIFT/ ][GIFT]] is used to infer the chemogenmic information based on
drug-protein interactions. Here chemogenomic information means the interactions
between the chemical substructures and protein domains. An Expection-Maximum
algorithm is then derived.   

Note: the updated version is maintained on GitHub.
